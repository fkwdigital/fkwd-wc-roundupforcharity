Adds a checkbox to the WooCommerce classic checkout to allow a user to optionally "round up" their order total to the nearest dollar with a report to send manually afterwards.

== Description ==

Adds a checkbox to the WooCommerce classic checkout to allow a user to "round up" their order total to the nearest dollar. In the admin, it provides a monthly report that you can use to manually send the round up amount to your charity of choice. This plugin does not automatically send the round up to your chosen charity.

This currently does not support block checkout, but will be added in a future release.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `fkwd-wc-roundupforcharity` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen (**Plugins > Installed Plugins**).
1. You will find **Round Up Report** sub-menu under the WooCommerce main menu.

For basic usage, have a look at the [plugin's website for documentation](https://fkwdigital.com/wordpress/fkwd-wc-roundupforcharity).
