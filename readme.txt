== Description ==

Adds a checkbox to the WooCommerce checkout to allow a user to "round up" their order total to the nearest dollar.

This plugin does not automatically send the round up to your chosen charity.

1. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen (**Plugins > Installed Plugins**).
